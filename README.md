# Trade Details Calculator
The Trade Details Calculator aims to simplify the process of determining crucial trading data for users, such as stop loss, take profit, and position size while using leverage.

### Development Outline for Trade Details Calculator

#### 1. Project Initialization:
- [x] **Environment Setup:** Set up a development environment using Node.js for server-side logic and React for the frontend application. 
- [x] **Project Setup:** Initialize the project structure using Express for server-side and create-react-app for the frontend.

#### 2. Backend Development (Node.js and Express):
- [ ] **API Endpoints:** 
  - [ ] `/calculate`: To receive input data and return calculated results. This will handle logic like calculating stop loss, take profit, and other necessary calculations.
- [ ] **Data Validation:** Implement input validation to ensure all incoming data is accurate and correct. 
- [ ] **Calculation Logic:** Design algorithms to determine stop loss, take profit, and other required trade details based on input data.

#### 3. Frontend Development (React and Redux):
- [ ] **UI Components:**
  - [ ] **Input Fields:** For account value, units, entry price, stop loss price, stop loss percent, take profit price, and take profit percent.
  - [ ] **Result Display:** To display the calculated fields as they're determined.
  - [ ] **Risk Display:** So the user can make informed trades being aware of their risk.
- [ ] **State Management (Redux):** 
  - [ ] Implement Redux store to keep track of the state of all input fields.
  - [ ] Create actions and reducers to update the state of inputs and to manage the calculated results.
- [ ] **Dynamic Interaction:** Use Redux and React state to dynamically calculate and update fields as soon as enough data is available.
- [ ] **UX:** Ensure a user-friendly interface, providing feedback and validation messages wherever necessary. 

#### 4. Integration:
- [ ] Connect the React frontend with the Node.js backend using Axios or Fetch API.
- [ ] Ensure smooth data flow between frontend and backend.

#### 5. Testing:
- [ ] **Backend Testing:** Write unit tests for all the backend logic, ensuring all calculations are accurate.
- [ ] **Frontend Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library to write tests for UI components, ensuring they render correctly and user interactions are smooth.

#### 6. Deployment:
- [ ] Set up a cloud-based hosting environment for both frontend and backend.
- [ ] Implement continuous deployment pipelines for rapid delivery.

#### 7. Documentation:
- [ ] Write technical documentation covering the API endpoints, frontend components, and the overall architecture of the application.
- [ ] Provide a user guide for using the application.
